## User Stories
The DRF API has only two user stories as the live API is only used for administration purposes for the front end application.

1. USER STORY 3: User Authentication - Admin Moderation
  - As an Owner, I can log into the admin console, so that I can moderate the content on the site.
2. USER STORY 24: User Interactivity â€“ Filter#
  - As a Owner, I can filter posts/profiles, so that I can find the content that I need.

## Database & Models
### Database
This project was built using a relational database allowing us to easily link aspects of the site with others.

During development, I used [DB SQLite which](https://www.sqlite.org/) which is the default database to use for Django - and for production [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) has been used and all data migrated during the deployment.

## Deployment
The Nexus DRF uses Cloudinary to host images, Heroku to host the website and ElephantSQL to host the database.
The deployment process for this application is as followed:
1. Create an account or Log into [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/).
2. Create New Instance
3. Select a plan, name and region.
4. Review the plan and Create Instance.
5. Find the recently created instance on the dashboard, click onto this and find the URL section and make a note of this.
6. Create an account or Log into [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).
7. Click New > Create new app, and select the correct region for this to be hosted > Create App.
8. Once created, Navigate to the settings tab, and enter a new Config Var called DATABASE_URL, paste in the URL from ElephantSQL. (No Quotation marks)
9. Add the new DATABASE_URL to your env.py file.
10. Within the project terminal, run `pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`.
11. Navigate to settings.py and add `import dj_database_url` underneath `import os`.
12. Add the following code to settings.py 

`if 'DEV' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }`

13. Ensure to comment out the `DEV` environment variable to ensure connection to the new database, add a print statement to confirm.
14. Make a dry run as a test of the connection to the database, if successful make migrations `python3 manage.py migrate`
15. Install gunicorn for heroku deployment `pip3 install gunicorn django-cors-headers`.
16. Update the requirements.txt file `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
17. Create `Procfile` and add the following code:
`release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate 
web: gunicorn drf_api.wsgi`.
18. In Heroku, find the app URL for the live application and copy, then add this to settings.py under `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
19. Add `corsheaders` to INSTALLED_APPS and add `   corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware
` to the top of MIDDLEWARE.
20. Under MIDDLEWARE add the following code:
`if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')
     ]`
21. Under the existing JWT code add `JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'`
22. Ensure the secret key is hidden in evy.py and replace with `SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` 
23. Ensure the DEBUG value is added to env.py and replace with the following code `DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ`
24. Set value of DEBUG to '0' in env.py
25. Update the requirements.txt file `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`.
26. Commit and Push all code.
27. In the Heroku app, open settings and ensure `SECRET_KEY` and `CLOUDINARY_URL` from env.py have been added as Config vars
28. Open the deploy tab, and connect with the GitHub repository, under manual deploy, deploy.
29. Wait for all changes to be made.
30. Enjoy!

The following steps can be followed to clone the project:
1. Navigate to GitHub and login to your account.
2. Navigate to the repository you wish to clone.
3. Under the green 'Code' dropdown, select your preferred cloning option.
4. On your machine, please navigate either to your editor / cmd / terminal.
5. Ensure your directory is changes to the location you wish to clone the project.
6. In the terminal type git clone and followed by the URL you selected earlier.
7. The project will be cloned to the location chosen.
